2.Wanwei is going to a restaurant where she knows the area is usually hard to find parking. She would like to know which parking area will be less likely to be occupied at her arrival. Wanwei doesnâ€™t input a specific address, she wants to drag the map to see which area is a better parking area. She doesn't care about the distance, and only wants to take the occupancy rate into consideration to find a parking spot.
